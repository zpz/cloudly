cloudly
=======

The scope of ``cloudly`` is evolving. New functionalities are added on an "as-needed" basis.

Currently, the package includes two substantial components, namely ``cloudly.biglist`` and ``cloudly.upathlib``.
Both had been separately developed for a few years prior to their merge into ``cloudly`` in December 2024. 
At the time of the merge, both were battle-tested and fairly stable with very compelling use cases.
